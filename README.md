# Fig.co scraper script

Er, probably don't use this. I use JavaScript's `eval` on the campaign pages from [Fig.co](https://www.Fig.co), which just made is easy to write a scraping script due to the non-static nature of their website.

But `eval` is considered an anti-pattern and can potentially be exploited by malicious partiesâ€”hence this script is a testement to my laziness.

Alas, here it is, for future embarrassment and reference.
